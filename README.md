## Personalized Workout & Diet Planning System

**CS5800 Final Project ‚Äî Northeastern University**
 By: Weifan Li, Hui Zheng, Ziqi Shao

------

### Overview

This project aims to provide **personalized daily fitness and nutrition plans** based on user profiles using **algorithmic optimization techniques**.

Users get:

- A tailored **daily meal plan** based on nutritional needs and dietary restrictions.
- A matching **workout routine** based on fitness level and equipment access.
- Data-driven, dynamic results based on real USDA nutrition data and gym workout datasets.

------

### üß† Features

- üß¨ **Meal Planning Algorithm**
   Use Linear Programming to solve multi-target optimization according to a set of constraints from US diet guidelines
- üí™ **Workout Selector**
   Chooses exercises filtered by body part, equipment, and fitness level.
- üìù **User Profile Modeling**
   Supports goals like `muscle_gain`, `weight_loss`, `endurance`.
- üìä **Real Datasets**
  - [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets)
  - [Gym Dataset (over 600 exercises) from Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/gym-exercise-data?resource=download)
  - [Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf)

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

#### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

#### 2. Make sure your data is in the `data/` folder

Include:

- `foods_cleaned_with_portion.json`
- `workouts_cleaned.json`

#### 3. Run the planner

```bash
python app.py
```
